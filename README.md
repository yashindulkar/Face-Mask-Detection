# Face Mask Detection using CNN 

### ➡️ The repository consists of Code & Datasets used for the Face Mask Detection

### ⚫️ Project Insights

1️⃣ The project consists of 3 python files

2️⃣ The first file is Data Preprocessing, which converts the data or image into gray scale 

3️⃣ The second file is Training, which trains the data using CNN model 

4️⃣ The third file is Detecting Mask, which uses the trained model to detect the faces for mask  

5️⃣ The data is segregated into Masked and Non-Masked

6️⃣ This gives the output with the binary representation as 0 or 1
